# ZX-Uno @ MEGA65: ZX Spectrum Core

This MEGA65 Core is based on Miguel Angel Rodriguez Jodar's great [ZX-Uno](https://zxuno.speccy.org/index_e.shtml). It was initially ported to the MEGA65 in 2020/21 by [sy2002](http://sy2002.de) and then in 2023, sy2002 & [MJoergen](https://github.com/mjoergen) ported it to the [MiSTer2MEGA65 framework](https://github.com/sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65/wiki).

The ZX Spectrum is quite a machine! For sure not self-explanatory for beginners and the core does need a specially prepared SD card, so **do not miss the [[Getting Started]] tutorial**.
