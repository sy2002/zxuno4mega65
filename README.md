ZX-Uno @ MEGA65: ZX Spectrum Core
=================================

**The ZX-Uno core is not self-explanatory and you need a specifically prepared
SD card to run it. You need to work through the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/sy2002/zxuno4mega65/wiki/Getting-Started)
tutorial.**

This MEGA65 Core is based on Miguel Angel Rodriguez Jodar's great
[ZX-Uno](https://zxuno.speccy.org/index_e.shtml). It was initially ported to
the MEGA65 in 2020/21 by [sy2002](http://sy2002.de) and then ported to the
[MiSTer2MEGA65 framework](https://github.com/sy2002/MiSTer2MEGA65/wiki) in
2023 by sy2002 and [MJoergen](https://github.com/MJoergen).
